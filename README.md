# DocAppointment

A web app similar to Practo created using React, NodeJS and MongoDB. This was created to showcase my knowledge on React and NodeJS. 

There are 3 kinds of users - Doctors, Patients and Admin. 

A doctor signs up by providing his details and uploading his documents. The admin checks these documents and approves/rejects the doctor's application. A patient searches for a doctor and can book an appointment.
